# Support and Resistance

## **1. Core Definitions**
*   **Support (Demand Zone):** A price level **below** the current market price (CMP) where buying interest is strong enough to overcome selling pressure. Prices tend to bounce up from here.
*   **Resistance (Supply Zone):** A price level **above** the CMP where selling pressure is strong enough to overcome buying interest. Prices tend to fall back from here.
*   **Role Reversal:** Once broken, Support can become Resistance, and Resistance can become Support.

## **2. Trade Application**
Support & Resistance (S&R) help identify **Targets** and refine **Entries/Exits**.

*   **For Long Positions:**
    *   **Entry:** Based on a bullish pattern (e.g., Marubozu).
    *   **Target:** The immediate **Resistance** level.
    *   **Stoploss:** Ideally placed just **below Support**.
*   **For Short Positions:**
    *   **Entry:** Based on a bearish pattern (e.g., Shooting Star).
    *   **Target:** The immediate **Support** level.
    *   **Stoploss:** Ideally placed just **above Resistance**.

## **3. How to Draw S&R Lines (4-Step Process)**
1.  **Load Data:**
    *   **Intraday/BTST:** Load 3–6 months of data.
    *   **Swing Trading:** Load 12–18 months of data.
2.  **Identify "Sticky Points" (Price Action Zones):** Look for at least **3 points** where price:
    *   Hesitated after an up-move.
    *   Hesitated after a down-move.
    *   Showed a sharp reversal.
3.  **Align Zones:** Find a price level where at least **3 sticky points align**.
    *   *Crucial:* Points must be **well-spaced in time** (not all in the same week). The more time between touches, the stronger the S&R.
4.  **Draw the Line:** Connect the points.
    *   *Note:* S&R is a **range/zone**, not a precise single number (give room for error).

## **4. Optimization & The Checklist**
To increase trade probability, use S&R in conjunction with candlestick patterns.

**The "Double Confirmation" Setup:**
*   **Long:** Bullish Candle + Low of candle coincides with **Support**.
*   **Short:** Bearish Candle + High of candle coincides with **Resistance**.

**The Checklist (First 2 Points):**
1.  Does the stock form a recognizable **candlestick pattern**?
2.  Is the **S&R confirming** the trade? (Stoploss should be near S&R).

## **5. Important Rules & Nuances**
*   **No Guarantee:** S&R indicates *probability*, not certainty.
*   **All-Time Highs/Lows:** Classic S&R lines cannot be drawn if the price is in uncharted territory (use trendlines instead).
*   **Discipline:** If the trade doesn't fit the checklist (e.g., Risk/Reward is bad because S&R is too far), **drop the trade**.[1]
