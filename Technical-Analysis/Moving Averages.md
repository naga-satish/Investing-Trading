# MOVING AVERAGES

## 1. Basic Concepts

Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- Average of closing prices over a period (e.g., 5 days, 50 days)
- Equal weightage to all data points
- Formula: Sum of closing prices ÷ Number of days
- "Moving" because oldest data drops off as new data comes in

Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- Gives MORE weightage to recent prices, LESS to older prices
- Reacts faster to current market price
- Sticks closer to price action than SMA
- Preferred over SMA for trading

## 2. Single MA Trading System

Basic Rules:
- Buy Signal: When current price > MA (Price crosses ABOVE the MA line)
- Sell Signal: When current price < MA (Price crosses BELOW the MA line)
- Stay in the trade until opposite signal appears

Key Characteristics:
- Works brilliantly in trending markets
- Fails in sideways markets (generates many false signals)
- Many small losses, but 1-2 big winners compensate for all losses
- Don't skip signals - take ALL trades the system suggests (you don't know which will be the big winner)

## 3. MA Crossover System*
*(Solution to reduce false signals)*

Setup:
- Use TWO EMAs: Short-term (faster) + Long-term (slower)
- Short-term EMA reacts quickly, stays close to price
- Long-term EMA reacts slowly, stays away from price

Trading Rules:
- Buy (Go Long): When short-term EMA crosses ABOVE long-term EMA
- Exit (Square Off): When short-term EMA crosses BELOW long-term EMA

Advantage: 
- Fewer signals, but higher probability of profit

## 4. Popular MA Combinations

| **EMA Combo** | **Time Horizon** | **Use Case** |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| 9 × 21 | Few days | Short-term/Swing trades |
| 25 × 50 | Few weeks | Medium-term trades |
| 50 × 100 | Few months | Longer-term trades |
| 100 × 200 | 1+ years | Long-term investment |

For Intraday:
- 15 × 30 mins (moderate)
- 5 × 10 mins (aggressive)

Rule: Longer timeframe = Fewer signals

***

## 5. When to Use What

Single MA System:
- Good for capturing long trends
- Accept that you'll have many losing trades
- One big winner will compensate

MA Crossover System:
- Reduces whipsaws (false signals) in sideways markets
- Smoother entry/exit points
- Miss some early moves but safer

## 6. Key Limitations

- Doesn't work in sideways/choppy markets ❌
- MA is a lagging indicator (reacts after price moves) ❌
- Can give late entry signals ❌
- But excellent for trend identification and following ✅

***

## 7. Quick Mental Checklist

For Single MA:
- Is price above MA? → Bullish outlook
- Is price below MA? → Bearish outlook

For MA Crossover:
- Did fast MA cross above slow MA? → Go Long
- Did fast MA cross below slow MA? → Exit/Go Short

## 8. Practical Tips

1. Use EMA, not SMA (more responsive)
2. Use closing prices for MA calculation
3. For swing/positional trading: Use daily charts
4. Don't fight the trend - "The trend is your friend"
5. MA works as both entry signal AND exit signal
6. Can be used to identify long-term investment opportunities
