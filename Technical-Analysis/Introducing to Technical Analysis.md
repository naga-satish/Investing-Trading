# Introducing Technical Analysis (TA)

## 1. Scope and Application
*   **Versatility:** TA can be applied to **any asset class** (Equities, Commodities, Currencies, Fixed Income) as long as it has **historical time series data** (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume). Learning TA is like learning to drive a car; once you learn the skill, you can drive any car (asset).
*   **Contrast with Fundamental Analysis (FA):**
    *   **FA:** Specific to the asset type (e.g., balance sheets for equity vs. rainfall/harvest for coffee).
    *   **TA:** Concepts (like RSI, MACD, Trend) remain the same regardless of the asset.

## 2. Core Assumptions of Technical Analysis
TA ignores valuation and focuses purely on price/volume data, based on three key assumptions:

1.  **Markets Discount Everything:**
    *   All information (known, unknown, public, or insider) is already reflected in the stock price.
    *   *Example:* If an insider buys before good news, the price reacts immediately. TA tracks this reaction without needing to know the specific news.
2.  **The "How" is more important than the "Why":**
    *   A technical analyst focuses on **how** the price reacted to an event, rather than **why** the event happened.
3.  **Price Moves in Trends:**
    *   Markets move in trends (Uptrend, Downtrend, Sideways).
    *   Major moves happen in phases, not overnight. Once a trend is established, prices tend to move in that direction.
4.  **History Tends to Repeat Itself:**
    *   Human psychology (greed and fear) drives market reactions.
    *   Since human reaction to price moves remains consistent over time, price patterns tend to repeat.

## 3. The Trade Summary (OHLC)
Since it is impossible to track every single trade in a day, we summarize price action using four key data points:

*   **Open (O):** The price at which the first trade executes when the market opens.
*   **High (H):** The highest price at which a trade occurred during the day.
*   **Low (L):** The lowest price at which a trade occurred during the day.
*   **Close (C):** The final price at which the market closes.
    *   **Most Important:** The Close is considered the most significant price as it serves as a reference for the next day and indicates the final sentiment (Positive if Close > Open; Negative if Close < Open).

**Key Takeaway:** To analyze markets effectively, you need to plot and study these **OHLC** prices on a chart.[1]
