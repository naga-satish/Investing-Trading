# Spinng top & Doji

## 1. The Spinning Top (The "Indecision" Candle)
 Unlike the Marubozu (which signals specific entry/exit), the Spinning Top signals **indecision** and helps you position your trade size rather than giving a direct signal [1].

*   **Visual Structure:**
    *   **Real Body:** Very small (Open and Close are very near each other).
    *   **Shadows:** Upper and lower shadows are visible and usually of **equal length**.
    *   **Color:** Does **not** matter (Red or Blue/Green have the same meaning).
*   **Market Psychology:**
    *   **Upper Shadow:** Bulls tried to take the market higher (failed).
    *   **Lower Shadow:** Bears tried to take the market lower (failed).
    *   **Small Body:** Neither party could establish influence. The market closed near where it opened.
*   **Core Meaning:** Confusion, uncertainty, and indecision. It is the "calm before the storm" [1].

## 2. Trading the Spinning Top (Context is Key)
A Spinning Top in isolation is useless. It must be read in the context of the **prior trend**.

#### Scenario A: Spinning Top in a Downtrend
*   **Interpretation:** The bears might be consolidating (pausing) OR the bulls might be attempting a reversal.
*   **Probability:** 50% chance of continuation (down) vs. 50% chance of reversal (up).
*   **Strategy (Buying):**
    *   Do not go "all in."
    *   **The 50% Rule:** If you plan to buy 500 shares, buy only **250 (50%)** at the Spinning Top.
    *   *If Market Reverses (Goes Up):* Buy the remaining 250 (Average up). You profit.
    *   *If Trend Continues (Goes Down):* Exit. You lose only on half quantity [1].

#### Scenario B: Spinning Top in an Uptrend
*   **Interpretation:** The bulls might be tired (reversal coming) OR they are consolidating for the next leg up.
*   **Probability:** 50% chance of reversal (down) vs. 50% chance of continuation (up).
*   **Strategy (Selling/Booking Profit):**
    *   Do not exit completely.
    *   **The 50% Rule:** If you own 500 shares, book profit on **250 (50%)**.
    *   *If Bears Enter (Goes Down):* You saved profit on half your holdings at the top.
    *   *If Bulls Continue (Goes Up):* You are still invested with the remaining 50% and ride the rally [1].

## 3. The Doji
The Doji is virtually identical to the Spinning Top in meaning and application.

*   **Visual Structure:**
    *   **Real Body:** Non-existent (Open = Close). Looks like a cross or a plus sign.
    *   **Flexible Rule:** A "wafer-thin" body is acceptable and can still be treated as a Doji [1].
    *   **Shadows:** Can be of any length.
*   **Market Psychology:** Same as Spinning Top—pure indecision.
*   **Usage:** Often appears in clusters with Spinning Tops. Signals that a big move (reversal or breakout) is imminent [1].
