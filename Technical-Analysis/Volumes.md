# VOLUMES

## 1. Volume Basics
*   **Volume = Total shares traded** (NOT buy + sell separately)
    *   Example: 100 shares bought + 100 shares sold = **100 volume** (not 200)
*   **Volume is cumulative** throughout the trading day
*   **Why Volume Matters:** Confirms trends and indicates "smart money" (institutional) participation

***

## 2. High vs. Low Volume
Use **10-day Moving Average (MA)** on volume bars as the benchmark:

*   **High Volume:** Today's volume **>** Last 10-day average
*   **Low Volume:** Today's volume **<** Last 10-day average
*   **Average Volume:** Today's volume **=** Last 10-day average

**How to Apply:** Drop a Simple Moving Average (SMA) line on volume bars in your chart.

## 3. The Volume-Price Trend Table

| **Price** | **Volume** | **Interpretation** | **Action** |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|------------|
| ↑ Increases | ↑ Increases | **Bullish** – Smart money buying | Go Long ✅ |
| ↑ Increases | ↓ Decreases | **Caution** – Weak hands buying (retail participation, possible bull trap) | Avoid/Hesitate ⚠️ |
| ↓ Decreases | ↑ Increases | **Bearish** – Smart money selling | Go Short ✅ |
| ↓ Decreases | ↓ Decreases | **Caution** – Weak hands selling (retail participation, possible bear trap) | Avoid/Hesitate ⚠️ |

## 4. Volume in the Trading Checklist

**Updated Checklist (3 Confirmations):**
1. Stock forms a **recognizable candlestick pattern**
2. **S&R confirms** the trade (Stoploss near Support for long / Resistance for short)
3. **Volume confirms** the trade (Above-average volume on BOTH entry candle AND the pattern formation day)

**Triple Confirmation Example:**
*   Bullish Engulfing pattern (Candlestick ✅)
*   Low of P2 near Support (S&R ✅)
*   High volume on P2 (Volume ✅)
*   **Result:** Strong signal to go LONG

***

## 5. Key Takeaways
*   **Never trade on volume alone** – Always combine with price movement
*   **High volume = Smart money presence** (institutions/big players)
*   **Low volume = Retail participation** (unreliable for trend confirmation)
*   **Always check volume on your entry candle** – It should be above the 10-day MA
*   **Volume color (red/green) doesn't matter** – Focus on volume **magnitude** vs. average

***

## 6. Quick Mental Checklist Before Trade
Ask yourself:
1. Is there a clear candlestick pattern? ✅
2. Is S&R confirming (SL near support/resistance)? ✅
3. Is volume **above 10-day average**? ✅

**If all 3 = YES → High-probability trade**
**If any = NO → Skip the trade**[1]
