# Marubozu

## 1. General Rules for Single Candlesticks
![Marubozu](Images/Marubozu.jpg)
*   **Definition:** Trading signals generated based on a single day’s trading action [1].
*   **Length Significance:** The length of the candle signifies the day's range.
    *   *Long Candle:* Intense buying or selling activity.
    *   *Short Candle:* Subdued trading action [1].
*   **Core Candlestick Rules:**
    1.  Buy strength (Blue/Green candle) and sell weakness (Red candle).
    2.  Be flexible with patterns (quantify and verify—minor variations are okay).
    3.  Look for a prior trend (The Marubozu is the **only exception** to this rule; it can appear anywhere) [1].

## 2. The Marubozu Pattern
**Meaning:** "Bald" in Japanese (implies no shadows) [1].

#### A. Bullish Marubozu (Buying Signal)
*   **Visual:** Solid blue/green body with **no** upper or lower shadows (or negligible ones).
*   **Formula:** Open = Low and High = Close [1].
*   **Sentiment:** Extreme buying interest. Buyers bought at every price point; the stock closed near the day's high [1].
*   **Implication:** Sentiment has turned bullish; expect the surge to continue over the next few sessions [1].

#### B. Bearish Marubozu (Selling Signal)
*   **Visual:** Solid red body with **no** upper or lower shadows.
*   **Formula:** Open = High and Close = Low [1].
*   **Sentiment:** Extreme selling pressure. Sellers sold at every price point; stock closed near the day's low [1].
*   **Implication:** Sentiment has turned bearish; expect selling to continue [1].

## 4. Trader Profiles: When to Enter?
Deciding when to enter depends on your risk appetite.

*   **The Risk-Taker (Aggressive)**
    *   **Entry:** Enters on the **same day** the pattern forms.
    *   **Validation:** Checks the chart around **3:20 PM**.
        *   *Bullish Check:* Is CMP $\approx$ High? Is Open $\approx$ Low?
        *   *Bearish Check:* Is CMP $\approx$ Low? Is Open $\approx$ High?
    *   **Pros:** Better entry price (closer to the close).
    *   **Cons:** The pattern might change in the last 10 minutes (failure risk) [1].

*   **The Risk-Averse (Conservative)**
    *   **Entry:** Enters on the **next day** (Day 2).
    *   **Validation:** waits for the close of Day 2 to ensure it follows Rule 1 (Buy strength/Sell weakness).
        *   *Bullish Trade:* Day 2 must be a **Blue/Green** candle.
        *   *Bearish Trade:* Day 2 must be a **Red** candle.
    *   **Pros:** Double confirmation that the trend is established.
    *   **Cons:** Entry price is often worse (higher for buy, lower for sell), resulting in a deeper Stoploss [1].

## 5. The Trade Trap (What to Avoid)
Do not trade blindly. Check the candle length range before entering.

*   **Avoid Short Candles (< 1% Range):** Indicates subdued activity. It is difficult to identify the true direction of the trade [1].
*   **Avoid Long Candles (> 10% Range):** Indicates extreme activity. While the signal is strong, the **Stoploss is too deep**. If the trade goes wrong, the penalty (loss) is too painful [1].

## Quick Revision Checklist
1.  **Check Shadows:** Are they non-existent or very small? (Marubozu confirmation).
2.  **Check Length:** Is the body between 1% and 10% range? (Avoid traps).
3.  **Check Time:** Is it 3:20 PM (Risk Taker) or Next Day Close (Risk Averse)?
4.  **Set SL:** Low of candle (for Buy) or High of candle (for Sell).
