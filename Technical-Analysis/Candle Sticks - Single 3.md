# Paper Umbrella: Hammer, Hanging Man and Shooting Star.

## 1. The Paper Umbrella

![Paper Umbrella](Images/Paper-umbrella.jpg)

A single candlestick pattern that helps set up directional trades.
*   **Structure:** Small real body at the upper end, with a **long lower shadow**.
*   **Rule:** The length of the lower shadow must be at least **twice** the length of the real body (Shadow to Real Body Ratio > 2).
*   **Color:** The color of the body (Red or Blue/Green) does **not** matter [1].

The interpretation changes based on the **prior trend**:
1.  **Bottom of a Downtrend** $\rightarrow$ **Hammer** (Bullish)
2.  **Top of an Uptrend** $\rightarrow$ **Hanging Man** (Bearish)

## 2. The Hammer (Bullish Reversal)
*   **Location:** Appears at the bottom of a downtrend.
*   **Psychology:** Bears pushed prices low (long lower shadow), but buying interest emerged, pushing prices back up near the open. Bulls managed to arrest the fall [1].
*   **Action:** **Buy (Long)**
*   **Stoploss (SL):** The **Low** of the Hammer candle.
*   **Entry:**
    *   *Risk-Taker:* Buy on the same day (around 3:20 PM) if conditions are met.
    *   *Risk-Averse:* Buy on the next day (Day 2) after confirming a Blue/Green candle formed [1].

## 3. The Hanging Man (Bearish Reversal)
*   **Location:** Appears at the top of an uptrend.
*   **Psychology:** Bulls were in control, but bears managed to push prices down significantly (long lower shadow) before the close. Even though prices recovered, the bears' entry signals a potential crack in the bull run [1].
*   **Action:** **Sell (Short)**
*   **Stoploss (SL):** The **High** of the Hanging Man candle.
*   **Entry:**
    *   *Risk-Taker:* Short on the same day (around 3:20 PM).
    *   *Risk-Averse:* Short on the next day (Day 2) after confirming a Red candle formed [1].
*   **Author's Note:** The author prefers the Hammer over the Hanging Man because the Hanging Man's recovery (long lower shadow) suggests bulls are still somewhat active, making it slightly less convincing [1].

***

## 4. The Shooting Star (Bearish Reversal)
Looks like an **inverted** Paper Umbrella.
*   **Structure:** Small real body at the lower end, with a **long upper shadow**.
*   **Rule:** Upper shadow length > 2x Real Body length. Little to no lower shadow.
*   **Location:** Appears at the **top of an uptrend**.
*   **Psychology:** Bulls tried to push prices to new highs (long upper shadow), but selling pressure forced the price down to close near the low. Bears successfully rejected higher prices [1].
*   **Action:** **Sell (Short)**
*   **Stoploss (SL):** The **High** of the Shooting Star candle.
*   **Entry:**
    *   *Risk-Taker:* Short on the same day (around 3:20 PM).
    *   *Risk-Averse:* Short on the next day (Day 2) after confirming a Red candle formed [1].
